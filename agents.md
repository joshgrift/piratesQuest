This is a godot 4 project. Always make sure your guidance is for godot 4. It's written in C#. Simpler responses are best.

I am a godot beginner so please explain what you do, keep the code simple, and add lots of comments. Use best practices whenever possible and explain them. I come from typescript so I'm familiar with OOP, but C# introduces a lot more concepts.

The goal of this project is to learn C# and godot at the same time. Give me api descriptions and easy to use descriptions.

Never ask me to send you a file. Always look for it.

# React
When you are editing react, be creative. If you want to make some significant changes, just ask real quick, but do so anytime you see opportunity to improvement. We want the UI to be fun, pretty, animated, and informative. It's our way to guide the user to the game loop.

# Scarlett (Guide Tab)
The port UI has a "Scarlett" tab — an interactive tutorial where a pirate character named Scarlett teaches the player how the game works through a branching dialogue tree (in `webview/src/App.tsx`, the `GUIDE_DIALOGUE` constant and `GuideTab` component). When you add or change gameplay mechanics, update Scarlett's dialogue to reflect them. Add new topics to the root menu and create dialogue nodes that explain the feature in Scarlett's pirate voice. Keep her text punchy, in-character, and include quiz questions where it makes sense.
