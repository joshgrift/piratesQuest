This is a godot 4 project. Always make sure your guidance is for godot 4. It's written in C#.

NEVER edit .tscn files. Instruct me how to make the changes in the editor.

I am a godot beginner so please explain what you do, keep the code simple, and add lots of comments. Use best practices whenever possible and explain them. 

The goal of this project is to learn C# and godot at the same time. I am an experienced OOP programmer, but I have never worked in godot or C#. Give me chances to learn hard problems. Give me api descriptions and easy to use descriptions, but don't write the code out for me.
