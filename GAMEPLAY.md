# Gameplay

> **Note:** Some features described here are still a work in progress. This document describes the full vision for Pirate's Quest.

Pirate's Quest is an open-world pirate sandbox MMO. There are no teams, no factions, and no rules — just the open sea, your ship, and everyone else. Alliances are fluid, trust is earned (and broken), and every encounter with another player is a negotiation: fight, trade, or sail away.

## Core Loops

The game revolves around three major activities, all of which encourage collaboration between players.

### Trading

Each port has its own **player-driven economy** with different items available at different prices. Buy low at one port, sail across the map, and sell high at another. Prices shift based on supply and demand, so no two trade runs are the same. Trading is one of the most reliable ways to build wealth.

### Questing

Characters at ports offer quests with unique rewards — artifacts, resources, components, or crew. Quests can also be discovered during other quests or through world activities. Characters don't just hand out tasks; they share information about the world and what's currently happening, pointing you toward opportunity (or danger).

### Combat

Fire your cannons (left with Q, right with E) at enemy ships — player or AI. Combat consumes cannonballs from your inventory and has a 2-second cooldown between shots. Different types of cannonballs provide different effects, and upgrading your ship unlocks more cannons and new attack options. Taking on powerful targets often requires teaming up with other players.

The rewards scale with the risk:

- **AI Traders** — Drop the goods they're carrying. A quick way to stock up without visiting a port.
- **AI Pirates** — Carry stolen loot and occasionally rare resources.
- **AI Fleets** — The highest-risk encounters in the game. Fleets guard valuable cargo including rare resources, components, and even artifacts. Defeating a fleet requires coordinating with other players and splitting the spoils.
- **Other Players** — When you sink another player, they drop half of their inventory. If they've been hoarding resources or running profitable trade routes, that's your loot now.

## The World

The map is hand-crafted with fixed islands of varying sizes. Some islands host a single port, others have several. There is no land exploration — the gameplay takes place entirely on the sea. Islands serve as hubs for trading, questing, and resupplying.

### Ports

Ports are safe zones — you cannot take damage while docked. Each port is unique:

- **Shop** — Buy and sell resources at prices driven by the port's local economy.
- **Characters** — NPCs who offer quests and share world information.
- **Crew** — Some ports have crew members available for hire.
- **Components** — Purchase and equip ship upgrades.
- **Healing** — Repair your ship using resources.
- **Stash** — Store items safely so they survive your death.

## Your Ship

Your ship is everything. It's how you move, fight, trade, and survive.

### Resources

Resources are gathered from collection points scattered around the map and from trading at ports.

| Resource | Role |
|---|---|
| Wood | Crafting, trading, repairs |
| Iron | Components, trading |
| Fish | Trading, crafting |
| Tea | Valuable trade good, crafting |
| Gold | Currency — used to buy and sell at ports |
| Cannonballs | Ammunition — consumed when firing cannons |

Gold is the primary measure of success. The **leaderboard** ranks players by their gold.

### Ship Level

As you progress, your ship levels up, unlocking more component slots, additional cannons, and higher base stats. A higher-level ship is more powerful but also a bigger target.

### Components

Components are equippable upgrades that modify your ship's stats. You can only have a limited number equipped at a time (determined by your ship level). Components are **lost on death**.

| Component | Effect | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Advanced Sails | +25% acceleration | 250 Wood, 50 Tea |
| Reinforced Sails | +15% max speed | 250 Wood, 40 Iron |
| Reinforced Hull | +50 hull strength | 100 Iron, 100 Wood |
| Expanded Cargo Hold | +100 cargo capacity | 250 Wood, 50 Iron |
| Masterwork Cannons | +25% attack damage | 150 Iron, 50 Cannonballs |
| Long-Range Cannons | +20% attack range | 150 Iron, 50 Cannonballs |
| Auto Health Regen | +5 health regen/min | 250 Tea, 100 Fish |
| Advanced Fish Nets | +50% fish collection rate | 100 Wood, 50 Fish, 50 Tea |
| Reinforced Lumber Tools | +50% wood collection rate | 100 Iron, 50 Wood, 50 Tea |
| Enhanced Mining Tools | +50% iron collection rate | 100 Iron, 100 Wood, 50 Tea |

### Artifacts

Artifacts are powerful items that **persist through death**. They can only be obtained as quest rewards. Artifacts improve ship stats or provide unique effects, making them the primary form of long-term progression.

### Crew

Crew members provide special abilities or stat modifiers. They can be found at ports or hired through quests. Building up your crew is a key part of growing your ship's capability over time.

## Death

Death is punishing but not permanent:

- You lose **half** of all items in your inventory.
- You lose **all** equipped components.
- You respawn after a short delay at a random location with basic supplies.

To protect against losses, use **stash locations** at ports to store valuable items before heading into danger.

## AI Ships

The seas are not empty. AI-controlled ships roam the world alongside players:

- **Traders** — Sail between ports carrying goods. A tempting target for pirates.
- **Pirates** — Aggressive ships that hunt players and steal their cargo.
- **Fleets** — Groups of AI ships traveling together with incredible loot. Taking on a fleet requires multiple players working together.

AI ships create a living world — there's always something happening on the sea, whether you're looking for a fight or trying to avoid one.

## Multiplayer

Pirate's Quest is a persistent, multiplayer experience. There are no teams or factions. Every interaction is organic:

- **Cooperate** to take down powerful AI fleets.
- **Compete** over lucrative trade routes or contested resources.
- **Betray** an ally when the reward outweighs the risk.

Communication happens through **emotes**, keeping interactions fast and expressive without breaking the flow of gameplay.

## Summary

Explore. Trade. Fight. Build your ship from a basic vessel into a feared warship. Hire crew, collect artifacts, and climb the leaderboard. Every session is different because the world is shaped by the players in it.
