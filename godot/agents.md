This is a godot 4 project. Always make sure your guidance is for godot 4. It's written in C#. Simpler responses are best.

I am a godot beginner so please explain what you do, keep the code simple, and add lots of comments. Use best practices whenever possible and explain them. I come from typescript so I'm familiar with OOP, but C# introduces a lot more concepts.

The goal of this project is to learn C# and godot at the same time. Give me api descriptions and easy to use descriptions.

Never ask me to send you a file. Always look for it.
