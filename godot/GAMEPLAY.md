# Gameplay Summary
ChatGPT took my 20 minute rant and summarized perfectly:

> A one-hour pirate sandbox where economy, exploration, and combat collide—designed to test how humans and AIs compete, cooperate, and outplay each other in a living system.

This is very much a proposal and very much subject to change. ALL feedback is welcome, encouraged, and requested. Positive or negative. 

## Proposal

Pirate’s Quest is a competitive, hour-long multiplayer experiment where human players face off against AI-controlled pirates—including player-authored AIs ranging from simple rule-based logic to neural nets or even LLM-driven agents.

Each round takes place in a shared island ecosystem and lasts ~60 minutes, optimized for fast iteration, balance testing, and emergent behavior.

### Core Loop

Explore a sea of islands with your ship

Gather value via:
 - Resource harvesting (wood, stone, salvage)
 - Trade between ports
 - Quests from ports, NPCs, and encounters
 - Upgrade your ship (speed, hull, cargo, damage—trade-offs, no perfect build)
 - Recruit limited NPCs that provide passive modifiers (scarce, contested, reclaimable on ship destruction)
 - Compete to collect Pirate King Skulls—the sole victory currency

### Victory Condition
- A finite number of Pirate King Skulls (e.g. 50) spawn via quests, exploration, and treasure.
- At the end of the hour, the player or faction (Humans vs AI) with the most skulls wins.
- Individual victory and meta victory (Humans vs AI) are both tracked.

### PvP & Stakes

- Matches support a fixed population (e.g. 16 Humans vs 16 AI).
- Ship destruction is devastating: you lose momentum and NPCs scatter back into the world.
- High-skull players become prime targets, creating escalating late-game conflict.
- Small players are often ignored—big ships with big hauls draw aggression.

### Design Intent

- Keep players inside the ecosystem—no offline optimization, no sandbox-breaking.
- Encourage experimentation, adaptation, and emergent strategies.
- Make the game engaging enough that players want to participate in the AI experiment itself.
- Make it beautiful and addicting, it should _feel good_ to shoot a cannon. 

### Summary
A one-hour pirate sandbox where economy, exploration, and combat collide—designed to test how humans and AIs compete, cooperate, and outplay each other in a living system.
